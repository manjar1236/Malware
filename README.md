# Malware classification
Most samples are collected from various github repositories where the malware has been classified already. Thanks to VirusSign and VirusShare for providing access to huge range of malware collection. Most of the malware which is classified already and not classified is double checked by me to make sure the data is good enough to train a neural network. Current we have some samples(worm, downloader, keylogger and crypto-miner) lagging. These variants are hard to find. For example I have found about more than 300 samples of worm after analyzing them, I found out they are all one single sample (Allaple) a polymorphic worm which makes copy of itself and every sample's copy is different in content as well as hash, But it is all one single worm (Allaple). This creates data duplication which affects the model badly as it relies heavily on those features. So finding unqiue worms have become highly difficult from repositories like VirusSign etc., If you ever have some of the collections kindly contribute by creating a pull request with the imports txt file alone (No EXE).

# I. INTRODUCTION
Malware analysis helps the researchers to find out the functionality of the malware. Malware analysis comprises of two major types,

Static Malware analysis.
Dynamic Malware analysis.
